Top-down view dungeon crawler with camera locked on character, similar to the original Legend of Zelda game, with many levels. There will be various types of enemies, puzles, bosses, and items, all placed throughout them. The current setting of the game is dystopian cyberpunk.
We will probably use the lightweight java game library, or something similar.
