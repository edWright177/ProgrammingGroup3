Top-down view dungeon crawler with camera locked on character, similar to the original Legend of Zelda game, with randomly generated levels. There will be various types of enemies, puzles, bosses, and items, all placed procedurally throughout the levels. The current setting of the game is dystopian cyberpunk.
We will probably use the lightweight java game library, or something similar.
